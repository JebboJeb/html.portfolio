<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. My name is Josiah Snell. I was born on October 18th, 1985. In my spare time I like to spend time with my family and play video games.

<p>Some of my favorate sayings are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It is what it is</li>
    <li>That is how I found it</li>
    <li>Sometimes, you have to get a little cup because the big ones are in the sink</li>
    <li>If one door shuts make sure it doesn't slam cause there are still people sleeping</li>
  </ul>
