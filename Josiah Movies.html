<h2>3 movies I have seen in the year 2023 and I rank them.</h2>

<h3>Super Mario Brothers</h3>
<p>I actually went to the theater to watch this movie. I took my son as well and this was the first movie he went to in the theater.
It is everything you would expect in a movie based on Mario. Pacing is a little problem. but still a good movie</p>

<h3>Major League</h3>
<p>An older movie, but still a classic. There are parts in it that is of the times. But also, really funny</p>

<h3>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</h3>
<p>A fun movie. Biggest problem is pacing as it blazes through the story. But there were funny parts in the movie and I would recommend to see at least once.</p>
